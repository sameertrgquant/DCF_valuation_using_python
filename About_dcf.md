# DCF_valuation_using_python

Overview
This repository contains a Python-based project for conducting a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation analysis. The DCF valuation is a fundamental financial modeling technique used to estimate the intrinsic value of an asset or company based on its future cash flows. This project serves as a demonstration of my financial modeling and Python programming skills.

This project gives the clear vision about the stock price whether it is overvalued or undervalued

All data required for this project is collected from the yahoo finance library

DCF valuation goes through three phases first is calculating the discount rate of the particular stock through Weighted average cost of capital analysis (WACC)

first, is calculating the discount rate of the particular stock through Weighted average cost of capital analysis (WACC)

Second, forcasting the free cash flow of the company and calculating the future value of that free cash flow and calculating the present value using the discount rate.

Third, and final step is after getting the net present value of the free cash flow than didvide it by the number of the shares to get the fair or intrinsic value of the stock.
